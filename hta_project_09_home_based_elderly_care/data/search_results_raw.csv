41174684,Parent-guided home skin care for infants via a WeChat platform: a study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Diaper dermatitis and eczema are common skin conditions that affect infants with a high incidence rate. The prevention and management of these conditions largely depend on parents' adherence to appropriate home skin care practices, with the effectiveness of these practices closely linked to their accurate and consistent implementation. WeChat, a widely used messaging platform in China, has demonstrated potential in promoting health awareness and self-management strategies. We have developed a WeChat-based parent-guided home skin care scheme for infants, specifically designed to assist parents in managing the skin care of newborns. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of parent-guided home skin care administered via the WeChat platform in preventing diaper dermatitis and eczema in infants aged 0-6 months, using a clustered randomized controlled trial design.",2025,Trials,10.1186/s13063-025-09186-x,Tongling Yang; Yuying Chen; Yalan Dou; Mengfan Qiu; Yanchen Wang; Siyuan Jiang; Xiaojing Hu

41174222,"Adapting health, economic and social policies to address population aging in China.","Despite its rapid economic rise over the past four decades, China now grapples with the challenge of accommodating and supporting its expanding aging population. In 2020, 18% of its population were over age 60, and 2.5% were over age 80, projected to rise to 39% and 10%, respectively, by 2050. This demographic shift places China at the forefront of diverse individual, familial and societal challenges. Here, we review these challenges in the context of emerging breakthroughs in basic and translational research, shifts in healthcare paradigms, evolving socioeconomic and political dynamics, and policy innovations. We synthesize China's current policies toward promoting healthy longevity in the general population, focusing on social health insurance, long-term care insurance, community and home-based care and palliative care, as well as gerontological research, public health prevention, nutritional and medical interventions, while identifying strengths and gaps. Finally, we propose suggestions to promote a more inclusive, resilient and happier aging society within China's distinctive sociopolitical and cultural context.",2025,Nature aging,10.1038/s43587-025-00999-8,Evandro F Fang; Yuan Fang; Guobing Chen; He-Ling Wang; Jianying Zhang; Chenkai Wu; Jing Liao; Chenglong Xie; Xiaoting Liu; Kan Wang; Yang Liu; Guang Yang; Qian Wang; Long-Tao He; Jun Li; Hou-Zao Chen; Lin Kang; Yawen Jiang; Huanxing Su; Hong Jiang; Na He; Jun Tao; Sean Xiao Leng; Richard C Siow; Chunrong Liu; Hafiz T A Khan; Yuanli Liu; Hisaya Kato; Takashi Sasaki; Jong In Kim; Andrea Britta Maier; Lin Zhang; Lene Juel Rasmussen; Jean Woo; Jing Wu; Huachun Zou

41167094,Home-based psychiatric hospitalization for children and adolescents during war times.,"Home-based psychiatric hospitalization (HBPH) has gained traction as a flexible alternative to inpatient care for adolescents with complex psychiatric conditions, but little is known about its feasibility when implemented rapidly during national crises. This retrospective study examined clinical outcomes and parental experiences following an emergency transition to HBPH during the Iran-Israel war. The sample included 22 adolescents (91% female, M_age = 15.15) with eating and other psychiatric disorders who were receiving care in inpatient or day hospital settings. Due to the two-week conflict, all participants were transitioned to a structured HBPH model combining remote clinical interventions (e.g., psychotherapy, psychiatric monitoring, nutritional support) with active parental involvement and local medical follow-up. Outcomes were assessed using clinician-rated (CGI-S, CGI-I), patient-reported (EDE-Q13), and parent-reported measures of self-efficacy, satisfaction, and treatment effectiveness. Results showed no clinical deterioration and moderate improvements in symptom severity and BMI. Parental self-efficacy was significantly associated with lower symptom burden and better clinical outcomes. While parents reported high satisfaction with the support provided by the clinical team, some expressed reservations about the broader applicability of the model, likely influenced by the sudden transition to home-based care. These findings suggest that HBPH, when supported by structured guidance and strong caregiver involvement, can be an effective alternative to institutional care even under emergency conditions. Moreover, the results highlight parental self-efficacy as a key therapeutic mechanism that may enhance treatment outcomes. This study adds to the growing evidence base supporting family-centered care models and offers insights for emergency mental health service planning.",2025,Psychiatry research,10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116788,Orly Lavan; Keren Fridwald; Amit Goldstein; Ori Laufer Laor; Avital Eberhard; Mira Horwitz; Nofar Valik; Tamar Tahar; Noa Benaroya-Milshtein

41148358,Indications for home mechanical ventilation in children: changes over four decades.,"Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) has been used for more than 40 years in the Netherlands. With this retrospective single-center study, we aimed to evaluate the demographics of children supported by HMV and changes in indications and type of support. We retrieved relevant data of all patients younger than 19 years who started HMV between 1979 and 2023 from a prospective database and from medical notes. A total of 544 children started with HMV (median age 13.1 years (IQR 5-16)). After a rapid increase between 1979 and 2017, the number of children treated with HMV stabilized. Nearly 40% of patients started HMV unplanned, because of failed weaning off the ventilator after surgery or an infection. Thirty percent of all children started with invasive ventilation. A majority of patients had a neuromuscular disorder (NMD) (n = 305, 56%) or a genetic syndrome (n = 85, 16%). The relative contribution of other diseases than NMDs increased in the 21th century. The relative number of patients younger than 5 years using HMV increased significantly over the years, from 13% in 1989-1998 to 30% in 2014-2022. This increase was even more pronounced for children using non-invasive ventilation (NIV), i.e. < 4% till 2003 and 30% in 2019-2022.",2025,European journal of pediatrics,10.1007/s00431-025-06559-x,Laura Verweij van den Oudenrijn; Michael Gaytant; Lieke Arts; Peter Wijkstra; W Ludo van der Pol; Esther Veldhoen
41143665,Bridging boundaries: a research consortium to advance hospital-at-home care delivery.,"The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of the hospital at home (HAH) model, driven by the 2020 CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home waiver that removed financial barriers to reimbursement. With more than 330 hospitals across 130 health systems implementing HAH, this care model offers promising outcomes and experiences while addressing rising health care costs and an aging population. However, further research is needed to define its scalability, appropriate patient populations, and long-term viability. To address these gaps, Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic established the Cleveland Clinic-Mayo Clinic (CCMC) Home-Based Care Research Consortium. The consortium focuses on creating a national registry, standardizing data, and developing evidence-based care pathways to evaluate the impact of HAH on patient safety, outcomes, and costs. Additionally, it aims to identify which populations and conditions can benefit most, ensuring equitable and high-quality care delivery. The consortium also prioritizes caregiver well-being, exploring virtual and hybrid models to address workforce challenges and enhance provider satisfaction. Recognizing health equity as essential, it emphasizes enrolling diverse populations and collaborating with community organizations to address social determinants of health. The consortium will also focus on true cost savings, workforce efficiency, and integration with home-based care programs, taking into account recent advances in technology and artificial intelligence. By fostering collaboration and rigorous research, the CCMC Consortium seeks to refine HAH into a scalable, sustainable, and equitable care model that meets the evolving demands of modern health care.",2025,The American journal of managed care,10.37765/ajmc.2025.89809,Jessica A Hohman; Richard D Rothman; Michael J Maniaci

41116998,Feasibility and Usability of a Post-Hospital Behavioral Intervention to Improve Mobility in Veterans.,"The strongest risk factor for readmission to the hospital is impaired physical function. We sought to determine the usability and feasibility of a post-hospital behavioral intervention to improve mobility in older adults with significant morbidity and functional impairment. We conducted a two-arm pragmatic pilot randomized trial of a behavioral economics-informed intervention to increase daily steps in Veterans, age 60 or older, receiving home health (HH) services post-discharge. The intervention group received a multicomponent behavioral economics-informed intervention, including daily step count goals, performance feedback, social incentives, and a pedometer. The control group received usual care, which included the use of a pedometer without additional interventions. Both groups wore an ActivPAL device to continuously monitor activity. Outcomes were measured at 60 days post-discharge. The primary outcomes were feasibility (enrollment and completion rates) and usability (device compliance and participant satisfaction). Secondary outcomes included changes in mean daily steps and hospital utilization. Differences in daily steps between the intervention and control group were examined using a linear mixed effects model. Sixteen out of the 37 consented Veterans completed the study (9 intervention, 7 control). All Veterans rated as very satisfied with wearing the pedometer, while 3 did not like wearing the ActivPAL. The pedometer data was more complete, with a missing step data rate of 5%, compared to 29% for the ActivPAL. The median (interquartile range, IQR) baseline step counts were 926 steps (2744) in the control arm and 1131 steps (2952) in the intervention arm. Both groups increased steps during the intervention; however, there was no significant difference between groups (",2025,"Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",10.1177/00469580251384787,Jacqueline A Benson; Matthew Wilson; Aidan J Flynn; Julie Stutzbach; Kimberly J Waddell; Robert E Burke
41112639,Understanding older adults' adoption of smart product-service systems for medication management in China: an extended UTAUT model approach.,"The rapid aging of China's population is intensifying the burden of chronic disease management and driving a shift toward home-based care supported by Smart Product-Service Systems (SPSS), such as smart pillboxes and medication management applications. However, the success of these technologies largely depends on their acceptance and use by older adults. This study aims to explore the behavioral factors influencing the adoption of SPSS for medication management among older adult users in China, using an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model. To better capture the complex interactions between the service delivery environment and users' personal capabilities and psychological states, the model incorporates three additional constructs: Self-Efficacy, Health Consciousness, and Medical Service Satisfaction. Structural Equation Modeling based on Partial Least Squares was employed to validate the model using empirical data collected from older adult respondents in China. The results show that Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Self-Efficacy, Health Consciousness, and Medical Service Satisfaction all significantly influence behavioral intention, whereas Facilitating Conditions did not demonstrate a significant effect. These findings highlight that, within the Chinese cultural context, family support and intrinsic health motivation are more critical than external infrastructure in shaping technology adoption. This study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of health technology adoption among older adults and offers practical insights for SPSS developers. It underscores the importance of culturally adapted and user-friendly smart systems to improve medication adherence and health outcomes in aging societies.",2025,Frontiers in public health,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1657473,Ruochen Fu; Xiaofei Ma

41094888,Smart Healthcare at Home: A Review of AI-Enabled Wearables and Diagnostics Through the Lens of the Pi-CON Methodology.,"The rapid growth of AI-enabled medical wearables and home-based diagnostic devices has opened new pathways for preventive care, chronic disease management and user-driven health insights. Despite significant technological progress, many solutions face adoption hurdles, often due to usability challenges, episodic measurements and poor alignment with daily life. This review surveys the current landscape of at-home healthcare technologies, including wearable vital sign monitors, digital diagnostics and body composition assessment tools. We synthesize insights from the existing literature for this narrative review, highlighting strengths and limitations in sensing accuracy, user experience and integration into daily health routines. Special attention is given to the role of AI in enabling real-time insights, adaptive feedback and predictive monitoring across these devices. To examine persistent adoption challenges from a user-centered perspective, we reflect on the Pi-CON methodology, a conceptual framework previously introduced to stimulate discussion around passive, non-contact, and continuous data acquisition. While Pi-CON is highlighted as a representative methodology, recent external studies in multimodal sensing, RFID-based monitoring, and wearable-ambient integration confirm the broader feasibility of unobtrusive, passive, and continuous health monitoring in real-world environments. We conclude with strategic recommendations to guide the development of more accessible, intelligent and user-aligned smart healthcare solutions.",2025,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/s25196067,Steffen Baumann; Richard T Stone; Esraa Abdelall
