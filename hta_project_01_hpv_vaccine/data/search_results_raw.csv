41176315,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for glioblastoma (GBM): current clinical insights, challenges, and future directions.","Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most lethal primary brain cancer with a median survival of under 2 years despite current best treatment practices. Early immunotherapies, including checkpoint blockade and vaccines, showed safety and immunogenicity but no survival benefit. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T treatments in GBM trials have yielded feasibility and antitumor signals but still lack long-term control. This review synthesizes recent clinical and mechanistic data to establish priorities for clinical trial design, patient selection, and treatment development aimed at achieving durable responses in GBM.Recent trials highlight two consistent observations regarding the delivery of CAR T treatment. First, that CAR T cells can be effectively delivered peripherally rather than requiring direct intracranial administration. And second, multi-antigen, regionally delivered products can induce measurable intracranial responses. These findings indicate that access across the blood-brain barrier is feasible, but persistent function is limited by tumor antigen heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive, myeloid-dominated microenvironment that accelerates T-cell exhaustion.Emerging development strategies reflect these constraints. Broader antigen recognition is being pursued through bivalent and engager-secreting constructs. Locoregional delivery through cerebrospinal fluid spaces enables repeated exposure at multifocal sites. Resistance modules targeting TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) signaling and myeloid suppression are being investigated to prolong persistence. Cerebrospinal fluid pharmacodynamic monitoring, such as measuring cytokines, chemokines, and CAR cell kinetics, may support adaptive dosing and minimize corticosteroid use. Patient selection criteria increasingly favor individuals with confirmed target expression, sufficient intratumoral T-cell infiltration, and minimal steroid exposure.Advances in manufacturing, including point-of-care platforms, allogeneic products, and in vivo CAR engineering, aim to shorten production timelines and improve access. Collectively, regional delivery, multi-antigen recognition, and microenvironment resistance constitute the current framework for translating CAR T therapy in GBM from transient responses toward sustained benefit.",2025,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,10.1136/jitc-2025-012308,Chase M Walton; Marcus Bell; Richard O'Neil; Ozgur Sahin; Bryan D Choi; Peter E Fecci; Ben A Strickland

41172525,Adverse reactions to bivalent vaccine against foot-and-mouth disease in beef and dairy cattle.,"This study aimed to evaluate adverse reactions to the bivalent foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine in beef and dairy cattle. A non-probabilistic intentional sample of 98 animals was evaluated: 48 dairy cattle (3-11 years old) and 50 beef cattle (18-22 months old; 23 males and 27 females), all clinically healthy and without previous cervical lesions. Observations were performed on days 0 (pre-vaccination), 15, 30, and 45 post-vaccination, through clinical inspection and palpation, with measurement of nodules, when present, using a caliper and/or measuring tape. Data were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-square test (p<0.05). Local vaccine reactions were recorded in 20.4% (20/98) of animals, occurring significantly more often in dairy cattle (33%) than in beef cattle (8%). Among dairy cattle, 56.3% (9/16) of those with abscesses were approximately 10 years old. Animals that developed lesions at the first evaluation maintained them throughout the study period. No weight loss was associated with vaccine reactions. In conclusion, although the bivalent formulation reduces adverse effects, abscess formation may still occur, highlighting the need for monitoring and the adoption of good vaccination practices.",2025,Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia,10.1590/1519-6984.296922,J M Muniz; H P Santos; D C Bezerra; N P C Bezerra; C J R M Rosário; V C S Coimbra

Vaccination is the most effective means to prevent morbidity and mortality caused by porcine enteric coronavirus infection. Hence, the development of an effective and safe vaccination strategy to protect against both PEDV and TGEV infections is urgently needed. Here, we designed and produced trimerized full-length PEDV and TGEV spike (S) proteins using an efficient mammalian expression vector system in HEK293F cells and reported that compared with the PEDV spike protein (2",2025,Journal of virology,10.1128/jvi.01452-25,Ding Zhang; Yang Yuan; Guangli Hu; Yunfei Xie; Xiumei Meng; ZhaoTian Zhang; Yu Zhang; Qi Liao; Ashenafi Assefa Gebremariam; Hanqin Shen; Guiqing Peng; Yuejun Shi

41166903,"Qualitative insights into vaccine hesitancy among striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) farmers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam.","Vaccination has reduced reliance on antibiotics and chemical treatments in major aquaculture industries like salmon farming, yet adoption remains low in developing sectors such as the striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) industry in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. This qualitative study examines Vietnamese striped catfish farmers' perspectives to uncover factors driving the low adoption of the available bivalent vaccine against Edwardsiella ictaluri and Aeromonas hydrophila. Between March and April 2023, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 44 purposively sampled Vietnamese striped catfish farmers across nursery and grow-out farms of different sizes and full spectrum of vaccination experience in the Mekong Delta region. The interviews covered the attitudes, knowledge, and use of vaccination among participants and were thematically analysed using the Framework method. The vaccine adoption landscape, visualised by adoption subgroups categorised in an adapted Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM), showed a clear skew toward non-uptake, represented by the prevalence of the 'Unengaged' and 'Informed sceptics' groups. The fragmented nature of the industry requires collaborative effort between nursery and grow-out stakeholders for effective vaccination. However, we identified a pervasive reluctance toward vaccine adoption in both groups of stakeholders, primarily due to cost-benefit concerns. Nursery farmers, bearing the costs of potential post-vaccination side effects, were hesitant to vaccinate fingerlings. Meanwhile, grow-out farmers questioned the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine. These concerns point to a critical need for interventions, either to alleviate perceived risks about vaccination or to develop alternative vaccine solutions that are more effective, user-friendly, and economical. Addressing these issues could reduce the economic impact of disease outbreaks and steer the industry towards reduced antibiotic use.",2025,Preventive veterinary medicine,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2025.106730,Vi L T Tran; Andrew C Barnes; Francisca Samsing; Ut N Vu; Kerrie Wiley

41162361,Chromatin profiling identifies putative dual roles for H3K27me3 in regulating cell type-specific genes and transposable elements in choanoflagellates.,"Chromatin-based mechanisms contribute to the exquisite regulation of gene expression during animal development. But how those mechanisms evolved remains elusive. Here we investigate chromatin regulatory features in the closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. In a model choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, we compare chromatin accessibility and histone modifications to gene expression. Accessible genomic regions in S. rosetta primarily correspond to gene promoters, and we find no evidence of distal gene regulatory elements that resemble enhancers deployed to regulate developmental genes in animals. Remarkably, the histone modification H3K27me3 decorates genes with cell type-specific expression, revealing a functional similarity in S. rosetta and animals. Additionally, H3K27me3 marks LTR retrotransposons, retaining a potential ancestral role in regulating these elements. We further uncover a putative bivalent chromatin state at cell type-specific genes that consists of H3K27me3 and H3K4me1. Together, these data support the emergence of gene-associated histone modification states that underpin development before the evolution of animal multicellularity.",2025,Nature communications,10.1038/s41467-025-64570-0,James M Gahan; Lily W Helfrich; Laura A Wetzel; Natarajan V Bhanu; Zuo-Fei Yuan; Benjamin A Garcia; Robert J Klose; Alex de Mendoza; David S Booth

41161728,Rumors and fears about the HPV vaccine: Perceptions of adolescent girls in government school in Addis Ababa.,"Cervical cancer remains a significant global public health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, like Ethiopia. The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is the most effective tool to prevent HPV transmission and reduce cervical cancer-related mortality, but the vaccine uptake remains suboptimal. The public perception of the HPV vaccine is marked by fear and doubt. Although girls are the primary targets of HPV vaccination, little is known about their perspectives, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study addressed the research question: How do adolescent girls perceive the HPV vaccine, and what factors influence their confidence and uptake? The aim was to explore girls' perceptions and to identify the challenges and factors that shape girls HPV vaccine confidence and uptake. This is a qualitative study that used eight 30 minutes focus group discussions (FGD) with 9 to 10 girls each for a total of 76 girls aged 12 to 15 from selected schools in Addis Ababa. Three trained researchers facilitated the discussion. From using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA), four key themes were created. The FGDs revealed that rumors, misinformation, and poor communication fueled girls' fear and limited their engagement in the vaccination campaign. Their decisions were influenced by parents, peers, and prior COVID-19 vaccination experiences, while minimal involvement hindered awareness and informed choices. Inconclusion, the study underscored the importance of effective communication and involving girls in vaccination campaigns to reduce misinformation, improve awareness, and increase vaccine uptake.",2025,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,10.1080/21645515.2025.2578894,Wosene Berhanu; Elisa Gobbo; Sibylle Herzig van Wees; Claudia Hanson; Adamu Addissie

US parents/guardians were recruited from a consumer panel for this online, cross-sectional survey. Parents (≥18 y) were eligible if their oldest child was 11-12, participated in their child's vaccine decisions/visit, had not decided on, or would refuse the HPV vaccine, and understood English. Parents were excluded if their child had medical conditions affecting eligibility for HPV vaccination or if they declined to provide consent. Sampling quotas were used for parent and child age, sex, and US region. Of 200 participants, half were undecided whether to accept HPV vaccination for their children and half planned to refuse (purposely targeted recruitment). Most participants were women (70%) and White (86%) with a mean age of 39 y. Significantly, more parents who planned to refuse reported delaying/refusing other vaccinations compared to undecided parents (57% vs 11%, ",2025,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,10.1080/21645515.2025.2578906,Kunal Saxena; Amanda Dempsey; Rishi P Verma; Jordana K Schmier; Shweta Kamat; Gregory D Zimet

41159022,SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce a diverse spike-specific CD4+ T cell receptor repertoire in people living with HIV with low CD4 nadirs.,"People living with HIV with low CD4 T cell nadirs on antiretroviral therapy have suboptimal responses to immunization. We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cell repertoire in individuals with CD4 nadirs of less than 100 cells/ul who received a primary SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine series as well as the bivalent ancestral/BA.5 spike mRNA vaccine. We tested the hypothesis that antigenic imprinting would result in the preferential expansion of pre-existing cross-reactive T cells that were primed against the 4 common cold coronaviruses. We found that these individuals made robust effector and memory T cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that exceeded the responses to spike proteins from the common cold coronaviruses. Furthermore, in 4 individuals, the number of SARS-CoV-2 specific TCRs far exceeded the number of common cold coronavirus-specific T cell receptors. TCRs that were cross-reactive for common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 comprised less than 10% of the total detected SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells. The diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific repertoire in 6 study participants was comparable to that of the repertoire in vaccinated HIV healthy donors. Our data suggests people living with HIV with low CD4 nadirs can have significant functional immune reconstitution with little evidence of antigenic imprinting due to pre-existing T cell responses to common cold coronaviruses.",2025,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2025.1663819,Alicia Mercado; Joel Sop; Steven Amanat; Li Zhang; Natasha M Chida; Christie R Basseth; Kelly A Gebo; Annukka A R Antar; Kellie N Smith; Zhen Zeng; Joel N Blankson
41158101,HPV vaccination efficacy in primary and tertiary prevention of vulvar and vaginal HPV-related high grade dysplasia and cancers: A systematic review.,"The impact of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer and condylomas is well-established, but its effectiveness against high grade vulvar and vaginal lesions (VIN/VaIN) and related cancers remains less clear due to their rarity. This systematic review assessed the efficacy of quadrivalent (qHPV) and 9-valent (9vHPV) vaccines in both primary and tertiary prevention of these conditions. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. qHPV showed 100% efficacy against HPV16/18-related VIN/VaIN and cancers in per-protocol populations, with reduced but still significant efficacy (71%) in intention-to- treat analyses. The 9vHPV vaccine further reduced risks associated with additional HPV types (31/33/45/52/58). Real-life data revealed decreased incidence of vulvar and vaginal cancers following vaccination, particularly among younger women. While vaccination appeared to reduce recurrence rates after initial treatment of HPV-related lesions, randomized trials have not confirmed a clear adjuvant benefit. Overall, HPV vaccination proves highly effective in preventing vulvar and vaginal disease, especially when administered before HPV exposure.",2025,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,10.1080/21645515.2025.2567704,Rosa Montero-Macías; Marie Adam; Roman Rouzier; Claire Bonneau
41157647,Impact of Vaccinating Adult Women Who Are HPV-Positive or with Confirmed Cervical SIL with the 9-Valent Vaccine-A Systematic Review.,"Infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) remains a leading cause of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases. This situation persists despite the availability of effective prophylactic vaccines. While global vaccination programs have significantly reduced the incidence of HPV in adolescents and young adults, many women presenting with HPV infection or squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) were not covered by primary prevention. This review was performed with the aim of evaluating the impact of administering the 9-valent HPV vaccine in adult women who are HPV-positive or have histologically confirmed cervical precancerous lesions. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a search was performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases. A total of 653 studies were retrieved, of which 7 studies, including 19,414 women, met the inclusion criteria. According to the literature, vaccination was linked to significant reductions in persistent HPV infection, progression of SIL, and recurrence of high-grade lesions after surgical removal. Complete HPV remission was achieved in up to 72.4% of vaccinated women, compared to 45.7% among unvaccinated controls. Vaccination after conization lowered the recurrence risk of CIN2+ lesions by 87%, with benefits seen regardless of timing. The most significant effect was observed when vaccine administration was performed before the surgical procedure. Furthermore, HPV vaccination notably enhanced viral clearance and decreased the likelihood of repeated surgical interventions. Despite differences in study design and follow-up definitions, the overall evidence supports additional vaccination in HPV-positive adult women as an effective measure to reduce recurrence and promote viral remission. These findings emphasize the need for clear guidelines and wider access to HPV vaccination for adult populations.",2025,Viruses,10.3390/v17101377,Dominik Pruski; Sonja Millert-Kalińska; Robert Jach; Jakub Żurawski; Marcin Przybylski
41156654,Human Papillomavirus: An Old New History.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) represents the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide and a major public health challenge. Nearly all sexually active individuals will acquire HPV during their lifetime, with the highest prevalence observed in adolescents and young adults shortly after sexual debut. More than 200 genotypes have been described, ranging from low-risk types, mainly responsible for benign lesions, to high-risk types, which are associated with cervical, anogenital, and head and neck cancers. While most infections are transient and spontaneously cleared by the immune system, persistent high-risk HPV can lead to precancerous lesions and malignant transformation, often in synergy with other sexually transmitted pathogens or in the context of microbiome imbalance. The introduction of vaccines and advanced screening technologies has substantially modified prevention strategies. Vaccination coverage remains heterogeneous, with persistent gaps particularly among males due to cultural, social, and educational barriers. Schools are increasingly recognized as strategic environments to promote awareness, sex education, and gender-neutral vaccination. Innovative approaches such as microbiome modulation, therapeutic vaccines, and liquid biopsy biomarkers are emerging as promising perspectives. This review aims to provide an updated overview of HPV epidemiology, clinical impact, prevention strategies, and future frontiers, with special attention to adolescents as a priority target group.",2025,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/pathogens14101043,Nicole West; Valentina Boz; Nunzia Zanotta; Carolina Cason; Giuseppina Campisciano; Alessandra Casuccio; Daniele Gianfrilli; Teresa Maria Assunta Fasciana; Giuseppina Capra; Maria Cristina Salfa; Franz Sesti; Barbara Suligoi; Francesca Valent; Laura Brunelli; Manola Comar

This review provides a comprehensive overview of KA, emphasizing advances in non-invasive diagnostic techniques such as dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), and line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT), which improve lesion characterization and differentiation from SCC. We discuss the histopathological phases of KA and highlight key features aiding in diagnosis. Furthermore, we explore the emerging role of human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly β-genus types, as a cofactor in KA carcinogenesis through modulation of apoptosis and DNA damage response pathways, especially under ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. Therapeutic strategies remain centered on complete surgical excision; however, alternative treatments, including radiotherapy, cryotherapy, topical agents, and systemic retinoids, are discussed with their respective benefits and limitations. Finally, we review current HPV vaccines and novel vaccine candidates targeting a broad spectrum of mucosal and cutaneous HPV types. This review underscores the importance of integrated diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to optimize KA management and highlights future directions in understanding its pathogenesis and treatment.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,10.3390/ijms262010040,Mariafrancesca Hyeraci; Dario Didona; Damiano Abeni; Francesca Magri; Francesco Ricci; Chiara Bertagnin; Arianna Loregian; Giovanni Di Lella; Antonio Di Guardo; Annarita Panebianco; Camilla Chello; Claudio Conforti; Elena Dellambra; Luca Fania

41147199,IgA autoantibodies demonstrate a novel mechanism of MuSK myasthenia gravis pathology.,"Patients with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis (MG) develop muscle weakness due to functionally monovalent IgG4 autoantibodies (Abs) that target MuSK and disrupt acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. Emerging evidence from other autoimmune conditions suggests that Abs of the IgA class-the archetypal immunoglobulin isotype at mucosal sites -may synergize with IgG Abs, contributing to pathology. In MuSK MG, however, the presence of disease-specific IgA Abs has not yet been recognized, limiting a broader understanding of IgG4-driven autoimmunity. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged cell-based binding assays, patient-derived recombinant monoclonal autoantibodies (mAbs), high-throughput B-cell receptor sequencing, C2C12 mouse myotube cultures, and passive immunization experiments. Among 112 sera collected from 25 patients with MuSK MG (discovery cohort), MuSK-specific IgA Abs were detected in eight samples, corresponding to 3/25 (12%) patients. This finding was validated in a second, independent cohort (validation cohort; n=14 individuals), wherein one additional patient (1/14; 7.1%) harbored MuSK IgA Abs. Across all cases, MuSK IgA Abs coexisted with MuSK IgG Abs, while domain-mapping demonstrated a polyclonal IgA response in 2/4 (50%) patients. Notably, in a paradigmatic case with longitudinal samples spanning over a decade, MuSK IgA seropositivity was persistent, and clonally expanded MuSK IgA B cells showed remarkable resistance to therapeutic B-cell depletion. We generated three patient-derived MuSK-specific IgA mAbs for in-depth molecular profiling. These mAbs were highly hypermutated, bound to distinct MuSK domains, and shared target epitopes with MuSK IgG4 mAbs. Two IgA mAbs cross-reacted with murine MuSK, enabling functional studies with C2C12 myotubes. Mechanistically, individual IgA mAbs promoted AChR clustering (indicative of MuSK agonism) and partially antagonized the pathogenic effects of MuSK IgG4 monovalency. When modeling a polyclonal response, however, the combination of the same IgA mAbs significantly impaired cluster formation, demonstrating cooperative pathogenic potential. Consistent with this, passive transfer of both IgA clones into mice induced a myasthenic phenotype characterized by progressive weight loss, muscle weakness, and structural disruption of the neuromuscular junction (effects similar to those elicited by a functionally monovalent MuSK IgG4 mAb). These findings uncover a previously unrecognized pathogenic Ab isotype in a subset of patients with MuSK MG and show a mechanism through which bivalent MuSK Abs may synergize to induce pathology. The identification of MuSK-specific IgA B cells could signal a role of mucosal or environmental factors in the pathogenesis of MuSK MG and other IgG4-mediated diseases, offering a worthy avenue for future research.",2025,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awaf410,Gianvito Masi; Kangzhi Chen; Alexandra C Bayer; Rafael Bayarri-Olmos; Minh C Pham; Annabel Wallace; Silvia Falso; Amelia Evoli; Raffaele Iorio; Kenneth B Hoehn; Akiko Iwasaki; Richard J Nowak; Kevin C O'Connor

41143859,Boosting Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Rates: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of Awareness Interventions in Réunion Island.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide and imposes a significant public health burden. In 2019, HPV was responsible for approximately 620,000 cancer cases in women, 70,000 in men, and more than 300,000 deaths globally. Despite the proven efficacy of the vaccine, vaccination rates remain alarmingly low in certain regions of France. In Réunion Island, only 16% of girls and 9% of boys under 16 years old were fully vaccinated in 2024. This underscores the need for increased awareness, education, and outreach programs.

While substantial efforts have focused on developing new chemical inducers for tailored CIP applications, repurposing established systems to confer novel functions remains a highly cost-effective and efficient strategy. In this study, we employed genetically encoded nanobodies to overcome key bottlenecks of two widely used CIP systems in specific biological contexts. By incorporating the bivalent COSMO module and UniRapR into an anti-mCherry nanobody, we reprogrammed the homodimeric COSMO system into a caffeine-inducible heterodimerization system and transformed the classic rapamycin-dependent ON switch into an OFF switch, thereby conferring new functionality of the existing chemogenetic toolkit and expanding the repertoire of CIP technologies.",2025,Chemical science,10.1039/d5sc05703e,Tianlu Wang; Tatsuki Nonomura; Mingguang Cui; Tien-Hung Lan; Pauline X Cai; Lian He; Yubin Zhou
41141875,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV Vaccine Awareness Among U.S. Adults With Depression and Anxiety: A Nationally Representative Analysis Using Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) Data.,"Background Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in the U.S. and can hinder engagement in preventive health services. Individuals affected by these conditions may have reduced motivation and lower health literacy, increasing their vulnerability to missed preventive-care opportunities such as vaccination. Awareness of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the HPV vaccine is crucial for cancer prevention but remains underexplored among adults with mental-health conditions. Methods We analyzed data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, Cycles 1-4 (2017-2020), to assess HPV and HPV-vaccine awareness among U.S. adults aged 18-44 with self-reported depression and/or anxiety. Weighted descriptive statistics, chi-square (χ²) tests, and multivariable logistic-regression models were used to assess awareness and associated sociodemographic and health-related factors. The primary aim was to estimate the prevalence of HPV and HPV-vaccine awareness, while the secondary aim was to identify associated sociodemographic and health-related predictors. Awareness was defined using binary (""yes""/""no"") responses to HINTS items, and mental-health exposure was defined as self-reported physician-diagnosed depression and/or anxiety. Results The analytic sample included 1,105 adults, most of whom were female (n = 709; 64.1%), aged 18-34 years (n = 623; 56.4%), White (n = 753; 68.2%), and urban residents (n = 956; 86.5%). Approximately one-third (n = 372; 33.5%) held a college degree, and n = 384 (34.8%) reported annual income ≥ $75,000. Overall, 944 (85.4%) were aware of HPV, and 839 (75.9%) were aware of the HPV vaccine. Higher educational attainment (χ² = 46.7, p < 0.001) and female sex (χ² = 6.88, p = 0.009) were associated with greater awareness, whereas Hispanic ethnicity (χ² = 9.4, p = 0.024) and male sex were linked to lower awareness. Participants with two or more comorbidities showed higher HPV awareness (χ² = 6.11, p = 0.047) but not vaccine awareness (χ² = 2.34, p = 0.311). Conclusions While overall awareness of HPV is high, disparities persist by sex, education, and ethnicity among adults with depression and/or anxiety. Integrating culturally tailored and literacy-appropriate HPV education into mental-health and primary-care settings may promote equitable vaccine awareness and uptake.",2025,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.95218,Akinyemi Akinwumiju; Ifeoma Amadi; Fola Ishola; Benedette C Okonkwo; Chinelo Onochie; Bibobra Tagbatsemi; Azeez Oseni; Obianuju Nwauwa; Diana Mensah
41141177,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Utilization and Its Determinants Among Adolescents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE): A Review.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause a range of diseases, the most common being cervical cancer. Although vaccines have existed for decades and are highly effective at preventing the illness, vaccination coverage is low, specifically among adolescents. There has been some success in vaccination campaigns in the UAE among girls, but very low male adolescent vaccination rates. It is essential to identify vaccination patterns as well as predictors of uptake to improve public health outcomes. This narrative review included relevant studies published between 2005 and 2025 in the PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Embase databases. The MeSH terms used were ""Human Papillomavirus vaccine,"" ""HPV vaccine,"" ""Human Papillomavirus,"" ""HPV,"" ""vaccine uptake,"" ""immunization,"" and ""United Arab Emirates."" Following the introduction of HPV vaccination in adolescent girls in 2008, the UAE saw a dramatic expansion of coverage, with some areas exceeding 90%. However, recent trends show the number of adolescents initiating vaccination has declined while completion is rising. Male data are limited but demonstrate very low coverage. Determinants of the uptake of vaccines include awareness levels, religious and cultural attitudes, fear of side effects, and concerns about costs and availability of the vaccine. Doctor referral was an extremely powerful motivator for vaccination. The UAE is behind its immediate regional neighbors in the uptake of vaccines, but leads when compared to international standards. While the UAE has shown tremendous improvement in HPV vaccination, there remains some room for growth, especially in male adolescents. Expanding education, drifting from cultural resistance to vaccination, and increasing vaccine availability are measures that are crucial to optimizing vaccine distribution and reducing HPV-related illnesses in the years ahead.",2025,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.93179,Sarah I Zahid; Bushra Alnuaimi; Kifaya Tamimi; Nadia I Zahid; Latifa Al Saad; Mazaffar I Zahid; Jayakumary Muttappallymyalil; Jayadevan Sreedharan
41138225,Human papillomavirus vaccine uptake in ethnically diverse women living with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"BackgroundWomen with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at an increased risk of infection from the human papillomavirus (HPV) and subsequently HPV-mediated malignancies and genital warts. The HPV vaccine is a highly effective intervention in preventing HPV infection and is recommended in SLE patients. We determined HPV vaccination rates and factors associated with decreased vaccination uptake in women living with SLE.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study in which we enrolled women with SLE (aged 21-45) for whom the HPV vaccine is recommended for by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The primary outcome was self-reported HPV vaccination as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). We collected demographics, clinical characteristics, knowledge on HPV and vaccines, and items for constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and determined associations between these covariates and HPV vaccination status.ResultsWe enrolled 75 women with SLE. Median age was 33 (IQR 27-40) and 20 (27%) had received HPV vaccination. Older women and Spanish-speaking patients were less likely to have received the HPV vaccine. When examining HBM constructs an increase in 'perceived barriers' (e.g. not knowing where to get the vaccine) was associated with no vaccination (r = -0.41, ",2025,Lupus,10.1177/09612033251390599,Sebastian Bruera; Yinan Huang; Savannah Bowman; Maria E Suarez-Almazor; Grace H Lo; Maria A Lopez-Olivo; Elizabeth Chiao; Jennifer R Kramer; Frederick A Pereira; Sandeep K Agarwal

41137394,Recombinant Dabie Bandavirus as an effective bivalent vaccine platform inducing protective immunity against intracellular pathogen and cancer.,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne pathogen endemic to East Asia, associated with high mortality and lacking approved vaccines or therapies. We developed a live attenuated vaccine platform based on a recombinant SFTSV virus, which lacks the nonstructural (NSs) gene, a key virulence factor that suppresses type I interferon responses. The resulting ΔNSs viruses, reassorted with the prevalent genotype B, showed attenuated replication in interferon-competent cells while retaining the ability to infect and activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Immunization with the ΔNSs virus elicited robust SFTSV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice and non-human primates, conferring complete protection against lethal challenge across multiple SFTSV genotypes, with immunity lasting up to 12 months. Additionally, recombinant ΔNSs viruses encoding heterologous antigens, such as ovalbumin (OVA) or TSA56 from Orientia tsutsugamushi, induced strong antigen-specific T cell responses and conferred protection against OVA-expressing melanoma or scrub typhus, respectively. Mechanistically, ΔNSs viruses enhanced APC activation, improved antigen presentation, and reduced apoptosis in infected cells, supporting effective T cell priming. These findings establish SFTSV ΔNSs as an immunogenic and broadly protective vaccine candidate, and a versatile bivalent vector platform for targeting viral, intracellular bacterial, and tumor-associated antigens.",2025,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,10.1016/j.ymthe.2025.10.044,Hyo-Jin Ro; Yebeen Lee; Kyeongseok Jeon; Yujin Kim; Seung Ho Baek; Green Kim; Joowan Kim; Jun-Gu Kang; Na-Yoon Jang; Si-Hyeon Lee; Sun-Young Kim; Yu-Jin Kim; Na-Young Ha; Yuri Kim; Young Ki Choi; Jae U Jung; Jung Joo Hong; Nam-Hyuk Cho

41134633,A cytoplasmic motif in HLA-E that drives clathrin-mediated endocytosis and VCP-associated postendocytic trafficking.,"Human Leukocyte Antigen E (HLA-E) is a nonclassical MHC class I molecule that exhibits dual immunological functions in regulating natural killer (NK) cells and T cells through unusual trafficking patterns. We previously reported that HLA-E surface expression is low and transient due to its cytoplasmic tail and dominant VL9 peptide, making it a dynamic indicator of cellular status for NK cell surveillance. Here, we identify a sequence motif in the HLA-E cytoplasmic tail that enables rapid internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) through interaction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex. Following internalization, HLA-E is routed to endosomes, where the same cytoplasmic motif and peptide loading together facilitate its reappearance on the cell surface-a process influenced by valosin-containing protein (VCP). Our findings reveal previously unrecognized endosomal trafficking pathways and regulatory mechanisms that distinguish HLA-E from classical HLA class I molecules, with broad implications for understanding the immunoregulatory roles of HLA-E.",2025,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.2514956122,Wanlin He; Andreas Damianou; Iolanda Vendrell; Klaus Früh; Daowen I Yin; Frances M Brodsky; Benedikt M Kessler; Simon Brackenridge; Persephone Borrow; Geraldine M Gillespie; Andrew J McMichael
41133908,Accessing Multiple Phases via Thermodynamic or Kinetic Pathways: The Impact of Bivalent Ferrocene Spacers on 2D Hybrid Perovskite Formation.,"Many semiconductor technologies require interfacing materials with different properties. 2D hybrid perovskites are one of the most promising candidates, combining the advantages of organic and inorganic layers. The networks of linked metal-halide octahedra with voids filled by organic counterions have proven high variability and can be tailored to specific applications. The geometric and electronic setup of the organic linker molecule between inorganic layers affects the crystal structure and the overall optoelectronic properties. Monoamines typically form bilayers in so-called Ruddlesden-Popper phases (RPs), while bisamines allow for making Dion-Jacobson phases (DJs), with only a monolayer directly bridging the inorganic layers. Therefore, it would be highly interesting if one could compare RPs to DJs directly to each other, meaning that they have been prepared using exactly the same organic linker molecule, which is the aim of the study presented here. Because of the potential interaction of π-conjugated compounds with the electronic system of the semiconductor, we have selected a special linker here: a divalent ferrocene derivative containing one primary amine attached to each of the cyclopentadienyl rings. These linkers form novel quasi-DJs, and their structure was determined by 3D electron diffraction and density functional theory. We found that by different crystallization kinetics, two quasi-DJ variants and even RPs can be obtained from the same spacer molecule. It takes time for the ferrocene-based linker to adjust to a particular conformation, giving the system also time to form octahedral connections other than the classic DJ/RP corner-sharing. The different octahedral linkages, ranging from face- to corner-sharing, have a significant influence on the optoelectronic properties. Thus, with a change of the synthesis conditions, it is possible to change the structure and the properties of the same educts. Our study also enables the first direct comparison of quasi-DJ and RP phases by achieving both with the same spacer molecule.",2025,ACS applied materials & interfaces,10.1021/acsami.5c14485,Melina Dahlke; Yaşar Krysiak; Marvin Treger; Carolin König; Sebastian Polarz
