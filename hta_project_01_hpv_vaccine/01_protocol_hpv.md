# HTA Protocol: Cost-Effectiveness of Introducing HPV Vaccination (Girls ± Boys) into India's UIP

## 1. Background
Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among Indian women. HPV types 16 and 18 account for the majority of cases. WHO recommends HPV vaccination in adolescence. The Government of India is considering wider roll-out and local vaccine production. A health technology assessment (HTA) is required to determine the value for money, budget impact, and equity implications.

## 2. Objectives
**Primary objective:** 
- To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of introducing HPV vaccination (9–14 years) compared to current practice (no HPV vaccine) from the payer (Government of India) perspective.

**Secondary objectives:**
- To estimate cost per QALY / cost per DALY averted.
- To conduct Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) for 5- and 10-year horizons.
- To conduct scenario analyses: girls only vs girls + boys, 1-dose vs 2-dose schedule, domestic vs imported price.
- To assess equity and programmatic feasibility in Indian states.

## 3. PICO
- **Population:** Girls aged 9–14 years in India (school and out-of-school), optional extension to boys.
- **Intervention:** 1- or 2-dose HPV vaccination using available vaccines (e.g. CERVAVAC).
- **Comparator:** No HPV vaccination (current standard of care with secondary prevention).
- **Outcomes:** HPV infection, cervical cancer incidence, life years gained, DALYs averted, costs (vaccine, delivery, program, treatment).
- **Perspective:** Government / public health system; secondary analysis: societal.
- **Time horizon:** Lifetime (50–70 years).
- **Discount rate:** 3% for costs and outcomes (range 0–6% for sensitivity).

## 4. Methods

### 4.1 Systematic Review
- Databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, IndMED.
- Search period: 2000–present.
- Keywords: "HPV vaccine", "cervical cancer", "India", "cost-effectiveness", "immunization", "quadrivalent", "bivalent", "CERVAVAC".
- Inclusion: Studies on HPV vaccine efficacy, coverage, cost, cervical cancer incidence, Indian epidemiology, modeling studies.
- Exclusion: Non-human, non-HPV, editorials, non-Indian cost data unless for sensitivity.

We will follow PRISMA 2020.

### 4.2 Data Extraction
Two-level extraction:
1. **Clinical / epidemiological data** – vaccine efficacy, coverage, progression rates, cancer incidence.
2. **Economic data** – vaccine price (per dose), delivery cost, cold chain, program management, treatment cost of CIN/cervical cancer.

### 4.3 Modeling
- Base model: cohort Markov model with annual cycles.
- Health states: Susceptible → HPV infection → CIN1 → CIN2/3 → Cervical cancer → Death (cancer) → Death (all-cause).
- Transition probabilities: from literature and GLOBOCAN / Indian cancer registries.
- Costs: 2025 INR, converted to 2025 USD for comparison; adjusted using CPI.
- Outcomes: DALYs averted, LYs gained.
- ICER = (Cost_vaccine – Cost_no_vaccine) / (Effect_vaccine – Effect_no_vaccine).
- Threshold: 50% to 100% of India per-capita GDP, or state-specific for sensitivity.

### 4.4 Sensitivity / Scenario Analysis
- One-way sensitivity: vaccine price, coverage, discount rate, cervical cancer treatment cost, vaccine efficacy waning.
- PSA: 1,000 simulations (gamma for costs, beta for probabilities, log-normal for RR).
- Scenario: girls only; girls + boys; 1-dose schedule.

### 4.5 Budget Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Time frame: 5 and 10 years.
- Inputs: target population, coverage, price per dose, delivery cost, wastage, training, IEC.
- Outcome: annual and cumulative budget requirement vs NHM/UIP envelope.

### 4.6 Ethical / Organizational Considerations
- School-based vs facility-based delivery.
- Equity: tribal, out-of-school girls.
- Cold-chain expansion cost.
