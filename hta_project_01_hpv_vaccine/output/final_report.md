## 1. Protocol (parsed)
# HTA Protocol: Cost-Effectiveness of Introducing HPV Vaccination (Girls ± Boys) into India's UIP

## 1. Background
Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among Indian women. HPV types 16 and 18 account for the majority of cases. WHO recommends HPV vaccination in adolescence. The Government of India is considering wider roll-out and local vaccine production. A health technology assessment (HTA) is required to determine the value for money, budget impact, and equity implications.

## 2. Objectives
**Primary objective:** 
- To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of introducing HPV vaccination (9–14 years) compared to current practice (no HPV vaccine) from the payer (Government of India) perspective.

**Secondary objectives:**
- To estimate cost per QALY / cost per DALY averted.
- To conduct Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) for 5- and 10-year horizons.
- To conduct scenario analyses: girls only vs girls + boys, 1-dose vs 2-dose schedule, domestic vs imported price.
- To assess equity and programmatic feasibility in Indian states.

## 3. PICO
- **Population:** Girls aged 9–14 years in India (school and out-of-school), optional extension to boys.
- **Intervention:** 1- or 2-dose HPV vaccination using available vaccines (e.g. CERVAVAC).
- **Comparator:** No HPV vaccination (current standard of care with secondary prevention).
- **Outcomes:** HPV infection, cervical cancer incidence, life years gained, DALYs averted, costs (vaccine, delivery, program, treatment).
- **Perspective:** Government / public health system; secondary analysis: societal.
- **Time horizon:** Lifetime (50–70 years).
- **Discount rate:** 3% for costs and outcomes (range 0–6% for sensitivity).

## 4. Methods

### 4.1 Systematic Review
- Databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, IndMED.
- Search period: 2000–present.
- Keywords: "HPV vaccine", "cervical cancer", "India", "cost-effectiveness", "immunization", "quadrivalent", "bivalent", "CERVAVAC".
- Inclusion: Studies on HPV vaccine efficacy, coverage, cost, cervical cancer incidence, Indian epidemiology, modeling studies.
- Exclusion: Non-human, non-HPV, editorials, non-Indian cost data unless for sensitivity.

We will follow PRISMA 2020.

### 4.2 Data Extraction
Two-level extraction:
1. **Clinical / epidemiological data** – vaccine efficacy, coverage, progression rates, cancer incidence.
2. **Economic data** – vaccine price (per dose), delivery cost, cold chain, program management, treatment cost of CIN/cervical cancer.

### 4.3 Modeling
- Base model: cohort Markov model with annual cycles.
- Health states: Susceptible → HPV infection → CIN1 → CIN2/3 → Cervical cancer → Death (cancer) → Death (all-cause).
- Transition probabilities: from literature and GLOBOCAN / Indian cancer registries.
- Costs: 2025 INR, converted to 2025 USD for comparison; adjusted using CPI.
- Outcomes: DALYs averted, LYs gained.
- ICER = (Cost_vaccine – Cost_no_vaccine) / (Effect_vaccine – Effect_no_vaccine).
- Threshold: 50% to 100% of India per-capita GDP, or state-specific for sensitivity.

### 4.4 Sensitivity / Scenario Analysis
- One-way sensitivity: vaccine price, coverage, discount rate, cervical cancer treatment cost, vaccine efficacy waning.
- PSA: 1,000 simulations (gamma for costs, beta for probabilities, log-normal for RR).
- Scenario: girls only; girls + boys; 1-dose schedule.

### 4.5 Budget Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Time frame: 5 and 10 years.
- Inputs: target population, coverage, price per dose, delivery cost, wastage, training, IEC.
- Outcome: annual and cumulative budget requirement vs NHM/UIP envelope.

### 4.6 Ethical / Organizational Considerations
- School-based vs facility-based delivery.
- Equity: tribal, out-of-school girls.
- Cold-chain expansion cost.

## 2. Search Strategy
PubMed search (example):
("Papillomavirus Vaccines"[Mesh] OR "HPV vaccine" OR "human papillomavirus vaccine" OR CERVAVAC OR quadrivalent OR bivalent)
AND ("India" OR "Indian")
AND (cost OR "cost effectiveness" OR "economic evaluation" OR "health technology assessment" OR HTA OR "budget impact")
AND (("2000/01/01"[Date - Publication] : "3000"[Date - Publication]))

Embase:
('human papillomavirus vaccine'/exp OR 'hpv vaccine':ti,ab) AND (india:ti,ab) AND (cost-effectiveness OR 'health technology assessment')
