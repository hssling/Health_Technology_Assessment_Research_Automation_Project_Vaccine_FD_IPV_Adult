41174218,Machine learning to predict the role of CHWs in shifting birth preferences away from homebirth in India.,"This study utilized well-known supervised machine learning algorithms to NFHS‑5 data of West Bengal, India, to predict the place of birth (home vs facility) by integrating CHW (community health worker) contact factors and women participant's perceptions about intimate partner violence (IPV). Although the study applied modelling techniques from conventional ML literature, the overarching contribution was identifying avenues to enhance public health policy response (e.g., efficient targeting of home visits and counselling by ANM/ASHA). The study concludes that, identifying likely homebirth cases among women with IPV-related poor perceptions applying improved prediction can enhance prioritising of CHW-contact and alter birth preference. The study improves minority-class learning using SMOTE on weighted NFHS data keeping in mind the complex survey design and SMOTE limitations. With respect to the ML model performance, Random Forest produced the highest test AUC (0.991) and accuracy (96.7%) among the 5 evaluated classifiers-LR (base), RF, MNB, k-NN, SVM and 0.950 with stable accuracy of 96% on hold-out data. The study does not bring methodological novelty in the underlying algorithms but generated actionable insights for equitable CHW allocation for efficient targeting using standard cross-sectional survey data.",2025,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-24446-1,Moumita Mukherjee; Chetan Harshal Tote; Anuj Batta

41171385,The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Quality of Life among Afghan Refugee Women in Iran.,"Refugee and migrant women are especially vulnerable to intimate partner violence (IPV), which can adversely affect their health and well-being. This study examined the association between IPV and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among Afghan refugee women living in the Torbat Jam camp, Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 226 married Afghan women who had resided in the camp for at least one year and were living with their husbands or partners. Participants were selected via random sampling from electronic health records. Inclusion criteria included willingness to participate and cognitive ability to complete the questionnaire. HRQoL was assessed using the SF-12 questionnaire, and IPV was measured using the Haj-Yahia Violence Against Women Questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using SPSS v26. 65% of women reported experiencing at least one form of IPV in the past two months. Psychological violence was the most common. Women exposed to physical IPV had significantly lower QoL scores (p = 0.012). No significant differences were found in QoL scores for emotional, sexual, or economic IPV. Strong intercorrelations were observed among types of IPV. IPV is highly prevalent and adversely associated with women's quality of life, particularly in its physical dimension. Multisectoral policies and culturally tailored interventions are essential to support refugee women.",2025,Journal of immigrant and minority health,10.1007/s10903-025-01791-x,Mohammad Rahimian; Masoumeh Abbasi Shavazi; Mohammad Ali MorowatiSharifabad; Sara Jambarsang; Zohreh Nasiri
41170662,"""They Say A Woman Has to Be Beaten Up in Order to Show That You Love Her, But I Don't See It That Way"": South African Adolescent Males' Experiences of Household Violence and Their Perpetration of Intimate Partner Violence.","There is a documented relationship between adolescent males' experience of childhood violence and later perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV); however, less is known about how this connection occurs. Analysis of 38 in-depth interviews with male adolescents from Soweto, South Africa was conducted to understand how they made sense of their experiences of household violence, IPV, and the link between the two. Framework analysis was used to compare experiences and perceptions within and among participants. Participants in this study described a range of violence from their caregivers, including being neglected, regularly insulted, and beaten with a belt. Despite many having experienced some violence in their childhood homes, most participants reported not having been physically violent toward or yelling regularly at their girlfriends; instead, they described efforts to keep themselves calm when their girlfriends were verbally or physically aggressive. The main reasons cited for avoiding the use of violence were a conscious decision to act differently than the caregivers who had hurt them and a strong sense of their moral duty as men to take care of their partners. While not recognized as IPV by the participants, elements of emotional abuse and controlling behavior emerged in their accounts of interactions with their girlfriends, the explanations for which were based in experiences of emotional volatility and beliefs about masculinity learned in the home. Findings suggest possible avenues for primary prevention of IPV with male adolescents, such as programs focused on building skills in conflict de-escalation and emotional regulation and/or on creating more positive norms around masculinity.",2025,Journal of interpersonal violence,10.1177/08862605251384899,Amy C Hammock; Janan J Dietrich; Lerato Tsotetsi; Elton Mboneli; Asanda Sipapa; Campion Zharima; Stefanie Vermaak; Busisiwe Nkala-Dlamini; Avy Violari; Rachel Kidman
41167126,From addiction to aggression: The spillover effects of opioid policies on intimate partner violence.,"Substance abuse is a major risk factor for intimate partner violence (IPV). We investigate how a key supply-side intervention - the abuse-deterrent reformulation of a widely-diverted opioid, OxyContin - affected IPV. Our results indicate counties with greater baseline rates of prescription opioid usage experienced relatively larger declines in IPV after OxyContin's reformulation. The reformulation reduced IPV only in states with smaller illicit drug markets, while states with larger illicit drug markets experienced increased heroin-involved IPV due to substitution towards illicit opioids. Our results underscore the importance of identifying populations at high risk of substitution to illicit opioids and moderating this risk with evidence-based policies.",2025,Journal of health economics,10.1016/j.jhealeco.2025.103073,Dhaval Dave; Bilge Erten; Pinar Keskin; Shuo Zhang

41163324,Intersectionality and Intimate Partner Violence: Risk Factors and Vulnerabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Humanitarian Emergencies.,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) presents significant global health, human rights, and protection challenges, particularly during emergencies. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exacerbated preexisting social inequalities, including those related to gender, race/ethnicity, and class, and led to an increase in IPV due to lockdown measures and economic stressors. This study aims to examine risk factors contributing to increased IPV among women and girls during COVID-19 mitigation strategies, explore the intersectional vulnerabilities of Black women in this setting, and compare IPV prevalence during the pandemic with other crises such as natural disasters and conflict settings. The review synthesized existing research to answer two primary questions. A comprehensive search was conducted across 11 databases. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed, published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, and included women aged 15 years or older. Data extraction and quality assessments were performed by independent reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. The findings revealed that IPV rates increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to risk factors such as economic stress, social isolation, and lack of access to healthcare. Vulnerabilities were particularly pronounced for women and girls from marginalized groups, including Black women, who experienced compounded effects of race, class, and gender. The analysis also found similar patterns of increased IPV during other emergencies, including natural disasters and humanitarian crises. Key barriers to protection from IPV included limited access to resources, social and community support, and discrimination at a societal level. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions that address the specific needs of women experiencing IPV during crises, with a particular focus on marginalized groups. Recommendations include strengthening support systems, improving access to healthcare and protection networks, promoting anti-racist and equity-focused policies, and enhancing data collection methodologies. Addressing the intersectional nature of vulnerabilities is crucial to developing effective, culturally appropriate solutions to protect women and girls during crises.",2025,"Trauma, violence & abuse",10.1177/15248380251367411,Marcella R Cardoso; Odette Del Risco Sánchez; Mary Greenwald; Fernanda G Surita; Annekathryn Goodman
41163052,Immunogenicity and safety of polio vaccines in infants: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.,"Poliomyelitis, preventable only through vaccination, remains a global health concern, with wild poliovirus transmission and the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses. The risk of further deterioration of the situation jeopardizes efforts to eradicate polio, which has been a long-term goal for the whole world. In this systematic review, an analysis of randomized clinical trials was carried out to comprehensively assess the immunogenicity and safety of various polio immunization methods in infants. Geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers (GMT) data collected after 28-31 days after immunization were used to calculate the geometric mean titer ratio (GMR), the analysis of which showed that both inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and Sabin strain-based inactivated polio vaccine (sIPV) as primary vaccination induce high antibody rates. Average GMR rates (CI = 0.05) for the 3 types of polio were 83.08, 33.60, and 166.30 for IPV and 234.35, 44.04, and 163.13 for sIPV, with fractional IPV showing similar results. One or two doses of IPV were insufficient to induce protection levels of antibodies against type 2 poliovirus. The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) and trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) also demonstrated immunogenicity in establishing immunity comparable to the inactivated vaccine; the latter exhibited an average GMR of 50.75 for serotype 2. High antibody levels were also induced by combined vaccine schedules, with sIPV-sIPV-bOPV (GMR of 1,172.7 for type 1 and 887.6 for type 3) and IPV combinations with diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (351.2, 258.8, and 573.6 for the 3 types) or pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (354.6, 117.7, and 540.9 for the 3 types) establishing particularly high antibody levels. Analysis of adverse events presented all vaccines to be well-tolerated and safe, with a tendency for combination vaccines to have a higher frequency of local reactions and fever. While the studies presented a diverse landscape with some existing areas of concern, this review provides structured evidence supporting the safety and immunogenicity of existing polio vaccines, as well as highlighting the interchangeability of different vaccination approaches in infants. Future research should aim to provide detailed reporting of adverse events in order to facilitate more comprehensive assessment of vaccine immunogenicity and, therefore, efficacy.",2025,Virology journal,10.1186/s12985-025-02977-3,Roman P Terekhov; Artem A Svotin; Maria D Korochkina; Anastasiya A Khodyachikh; Mikhail A Varnavskiy; Anastasia N Piniaeva; Yury Yu Ivin; Dmitry D Zhdanov; Liubov I Kozlovskaya; Amir Taldaev

41153140,Factors for Perceived Helpfulness of Support Sources Among Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence.,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) has far-reaching health and social consequences, particularly for survivors experiencing polyvictimization-multiple forms of IPV such as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. This study examined help-seeking behaviors and the perceived helpfulness of formal support sources (police, medical professionals, and psychologists) among a nationally representative sample of 2387 IPV survivors drawn from the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) in the United States. Latent class analysis identified three distinct polyvictimization profiles: Coercive Control and Psychological Aggression (CCPA), Psychological and Physical Violence (PPV), and Multiple Violence (MV). Survivors' patterns of formal help-seeking varied significantly by gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and type of victimization. Psychologists were the most commonly contacted and perceived as the most helpful overall, though disparities emerged. Female survivors and those with less severe victimization were more likely to rate support as helpful, whereas male and sexual/gender minority (SGM) survivors, particularly those facing severe or multiple forms of violence, were less likely to find formal sources helpful-especially law enforcement. These findings highlight the need for more inclusive, culturally competent, and trauma-informed services tailored to the diverse experiences of IPV survivors.",2025,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/bs15101350,Hyunkag Cho; Woojong Kim; Kaytee Gillis; Kasey Goetz

41138920,Transgenerational effects of violence in adolescents exposed to grandmaternal intimate partner violence during pregnancy: heart rate variability and DNA methylation.,"Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy may exert enduring effects on physiological stress responses across generations. Although the biological mechanisms remain unclear, epigenetic modifications might be involved. The present study investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) in adolescence is associated with grandmaternal IPV exposure during pregnancy and DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns. A cohort of 86 participants (57% female) from São Gonçalo, Brazil, was assessed at two time points (M ages: 13.7, 18.6 years). At the first assessment, grandmaternal retrospective reports of IPV during pregnancy were collected, and children's DNAm was quantified from saliva samples using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. At the second assessment, HRV was recorded while participants completed a control task (sociodemographic interview) and during the recall of their most traumatic lifetime experience (via the UCLA trauma interview). HRV reactivity was computed as the log-ratio between HRV during the trauma and control conditions. Adolescents exposed to grandmaternal IPV during pregnancy showed significantly lower HRV under control condition and increased HRV reactivity compared to non-exposed participants. DNAm at candidate genes (CORIN, BARX1, and CLPX) were associated with HRV metrics. Additionally, over 700 differentially methylated regions were identified in association with HRV. These findings suggest a transgenerational effect of prenatal IPV exposure on adolescent physiological responses, with multiple differentially methylated CpG sites and regions linked to HRV. The results emphasize the urgency of public health efforts to prevent IPV during pregnancy, not only to protect maternal health but also to promote long-term well-being in future generations.",2025,Behavioural brain research,10.1016/j.bbr.2025.115886,Nayara de Oliveira; Aline F Bastos; Fernanda Serpeloni; Simone G Assis

41137610,A Scoping Review of Intimate Partner Violence Interventions in Asian American Populations: Current Status and Future Directions.,"Asian Americans are one of the fastest-growing racial/ethnic populations in the United States, comprising approximately 7% of the total population. Despite their significant presence, Asian communities have often been overlooked in discussions of crime and victimization, including intimate partner violence (IPV). Due to limited attention from scholars and policymakers, the extent of IPV within Asian communities remains poorly understood, as does the availability and effectiveness of intervention programs designed to prevent IPV. To address this gap, we aimed to assess the current status of IPV intervention programs among Asian communities in the United States and provide recommendations for future research and policy based on our findings. We analyzed a total of nine studies-seven peer-reviewed journal articles and two dissertations. Most studies employed quantitative methods, utilizing multiple data collection techniques, including surveys, in-depth interviews, and (quasi-)experimental designs. Our findings identified five different types of interventions, primarily targeting community members and leaders to prevent IPV among Asian women. These interventions employed (quasi-)experimental designs with pre- and post-measurements and assessed outcomes multiple times. However, none of the studies justified their chosen number of assessments or the duration of the follow-up period. We discuss the policy implications of our findings and outline a future research agenda to improve IPV intervention efforts within Asian communities.",2025,"Trauma, violence & abuse",10.1177/15248380251375916,Chunrye Kim; Jeongsuk Kim; Jessica Szempruch; Maria Salome Velez
41137546,Short-Term Health and Safety Outcomes Associated With Digital Hotline Use at Interpersonal Violence-Focused Agencies.,"Community organizations strive to help survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), stalking, sexual assault and human trafficking address health and safety needs. Hotline, offered by local agencies, is the first line of support for survivors to address needs. Increasingly, hotline is offered in digital formats (chat and text) to meet the emergent needs of survivors. Despite the growing use of digital hotline, little is known about short-term health and safety changes associated with use. Partnering with 2 local agencies in a Southern state, we recruited first-time digital hotline participants to an online baseline and follow-up (6 weeks later) assessment (n = 237) to examine changes in health (e.g. physical health, depression, PTSD) and safety (tools related to safety, perception of safety). Descriptive statistics, paired sample t-tests, chi-square, and regression modeling were used for data analysis. At 6 weeks post-digital hotline use, depression and PTSD symptoms had significantly decreased, and hope and feelings of safety had significantly increased. No changes were observed for physical health.

Therefore, it is important to identify the proximal factors that explain the association between childhood maltreatment and empathy. Understanding how significant difficulties in recognizing and verbalizing inner states (high levels of alexithymia) and poor emotion decoding abilities influence the relationship between childhood maltreatment and empathy may help further clarify this association. Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the association between childhood maltreatment and empathy in a sample of perpetrators of IPV and to further assess whether alexithymia and emotion decoding abilities moderate this association.",2025,Child abuse & neglect,10.1016/j.chiabu.2025.107760,Ángel Romero-Martínez; Carolina Sarrate-Costa; Marisol Lila; Luis Moya-Albiol
41124165,Help seeking for intimate partner violence in a resource-constrained setting: A latent class analysis of the Nigerian demographic health survey dataset.,"Help seeking for intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex process that involves reaching out to an external party. Women in resource constrained settings face unique constraints when seeking help for IPV but the latent classes of their help seeking behaviour in IPV has not been described. We therefore conducted a latent class analysis of help seeking behaviour among women experiencing IPV in Nigeria using the nationally representative 2018 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data. Nigeria was selected as an example of a resource constrained setting because close to half of its population is multidimensionally poor with significant financial and service barriers. Help seeking was defined by the latent class indicators of the places where or people from whom women sought help. The data were analysed in MPlus version 8.10 and survey sampling weights were applied. The relative fit of the models was compared using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Adjusted BIC (ABIC), Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR) p-values, and entropy values. Of the 3,054 women who experienced physical or sexual violence, 1,041 (33%) women reported seeking for help and a four-class model of help seeking behaviour (BIC = 3910.80, ABIC = 3837.70, LMR p-value = 0.0002, and entropy value = 0.92) was described: Class I (Own Family; 49%), Class II (Everywhere; 18%), Class III (Predominantly Formal; 5%), and Class IV (Predominantly Partner's Family; 28%). Women evinced a high reliance on informal sources for help. However, women with a history of sexual violence were most likely to access formal sources of help. Interventions for IPV have focussed on formal services but in resource constrained settings, the focus needs to be redirected to interventions for empowering informal sources of help (family, friends and neighbours) without neglecting formal systems.",2025,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0334905,Omolola Titilayo Alade; Forough Farrokhyar; Sheila Ann Sprague; Anita Acai; Mohit Bhandari

41121992,Barriers and Facilitators of Help-Seeking Among Asian Women Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence in the United States: A Scoping Review.,"Asian women survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) often face compound challenges in addressing abuse and its negative consequences. While prior reviews have identified barriers to help-seeking, fewer have examined the factors that facilitate help-seeking. The current scoping review addresses this gap by synthesizing findings from 33 empirical studies published between 2003 and 2024 that explore the help-seeking experiences of Asian women IPV survivors in the United States. The review indicates that help-seeking is a non-linear, iterative process; the individuals or systems that survivors initially approach can significantly influence their subsequent actions. The reviewed studies suggest that women's help-seeking typically begins with recognizing that IPV is occurring and acknowledging it as an issue that needs to be addressed. When survivors seek support, facilitators include supportive informal and formal networks, as well as human and social capital, such as English proficiency, having U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, and transportation and financial independence. Once survivors engage with services, it is crucial that these services are comprehensive, bilingual, and culturally responsive. Survivor strengths, including self-efficacy, personal aspiration, and self-care practices, also play a critical role in fostering resilience. Implications focus on improving responses to IPV among informal networks and formal systems, including increasing IPV awareness through evidence-based tools, developing community-based strategies to transform social networks into sources of support, attuning interventions to survivors' help-seeking readiness, and ensuring services are linguistically and culturally appropriate.",2025,"Trauma, violence & abuse",10.1177/15248380251381816,Shih-Ying Cheng; Jieun Lee; Bianca Schindeler; Ji Hye Kim; Jill Theresa Messing

IPV is characterized by physical, psychological, or sexual harm inflicted by an intimate partner, and a growing body of evidence suggests that ACEs have a significant role in negatively shaping the psychosocial development of children and adolescents. Yet, few studies have qualitatively explored IPV in YSMM, let alone how ACEs influence perceptions of IPV in this population.

41115847,Psychotherapy and Counseling Providers' Subjective Experiences Serving Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV): A Scoping Review of Qualitative Research.,"Although many survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) seek psychotherapy or counseling, providers often lack consistent training in serving this population, leading to variable-and at times harmful-experiences for survivor-clients. A review of existing research is necessary to better understand the perspectives of psychotherapy and counseling professionals working with this population. This scoping review examines qualitative studies focused on the experiences of providers working with adult IPV survivors in individual therapy. Following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for scoping reviews, 21 studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria for this review (i.e., qualitative studies with samples of psychotherapy or counseling providers who serve adult IPV survivors). These studies reveal significant personal challenges for providers, alongside limited training, education, and supervision. Providers demonstrated varying conceptualizations of IPV, employed diverse interventions, and described the influence of cultural, identity-related, and structural factors on their work. Many providers felt that systemic and societal barriers impacted their ability to effectively serve survivors. Findings indicate the need for comprehensive training, supervision, and resources to support providers in their work with IPV survivors. Yet, as IPV is rooted in structural inequities, individual-level interventions, while important, are not sufficient to address this social problem.",2025,"Trauma, violence & abuse",10.1177/15248380251372158,Ellen R Gutowski; Yuliya Medzhitova; Sharan Sagoo; Aïda Retta; Prameshta Prasath; Emily Hector

41106619,Intimate partner violence in United States military veterans: Results from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study.,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant concern among military personnel and veterans, yet few studies have examined its prevalence and correlates in nationally representative samples of veterans. This study aimed to address this gap by identifying the prevalence of IPV and factors associated with lifetime physical IPV perpetration, expanding on prior research by including a broader range of traumatic experiences (e.g., military sexual trauma) and psychiatric variables (e.g., nicotine dependence, non-suicidal self-injury). Results revealed that, of 2376 veterans surveyed, 208 (weighted 8.4 %, 95 % confidence interval = 7.0-10.1 %) reported lifetime physical IPV perpetration. Relative to veterans without a history of physical IPV perpetration, those who reported IPV perpetration endorsed more childhood and total lifetime traumatic events and were more likely to report military sexual trauma. They were also more likely to screen positive for lifetime nicotine dependence, report past suicide attempts, and endorse higher levels of hostility. Additionally, IPV perpetrators were more likely to screen positive for current alcohol use disorder and report current passive suicidal ideation. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive screening and tailored interventions for veterans with a history of IPV, as they may face elevated risk for trauma-related mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and suicidal behaviors.",2025,Journal of affective disorders,10.1016/j.jad.2025.120447,Lorig K Kachadourian; Ian C Fischer; Candice Presseau; Galina A Portnoy; Robert H Pietrzak
