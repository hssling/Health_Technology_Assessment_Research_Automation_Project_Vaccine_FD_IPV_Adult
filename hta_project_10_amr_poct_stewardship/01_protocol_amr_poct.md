# HTA Protocol: Antimicrobial Stewardship and Point-of-Care Testing vs Empirical Antibiotic Use at Primary Care Level in India

## 1. Background
India faces one of the highest rates of antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally. A key driver is empirical antibiotic prescribing for febrile and respiratory illnesses at primary and secondary levels without diagnostic confirmation. Point-of-care tests (POCT) such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), or rapid bacterial/viral panels, when integrated with antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) training, can potentially reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.

This HTA evaluates whether introducing POCT + AMS is cost-effective compared to current empirical antibiotic practices in primary care settings, and estimates the programmatic budget impact.

## 2. Objectives
- **Primary:** Evaluate cost-effectiveness (cost per antibiotic prescription avoided; cost per AMR infection averted) of POCT + AMS versus empirical antibiotics.
- **Secondary:** Estimate budget impact for NHM/state health systems and identify thresholds where POCT + AMS is cost-saving.

## 3. PICO
- **Population:** Patients with acute febrile or respiratory illness attending PHC/CHC outpatient clinics.
- **Intervention:** POCT (CRP or equivalent) + AMS training and feedback.
- **Comparator:** Current practice (empirical antibiotic use without diagnostics).
- **Outcomes:** Reduction in antibiotic use, AMR infections averted, cost per case managed, cost per QALY gained.
- **Perspective:** Health system; secondary societal.
- **Time horizon:** 1 year (base case); 5 years (for AMR progression).
- **Discounting:** 3%.

## 4. Methods
- Decision tree linking infection etiology, test accuracy, antibiotic use, and outcomes.
- Costs:
  - POCT device and consumable per test.
  - AMS training and supervision.
  - Antibiotic and complication treatment costs.
- Effectiveness:
  - Reduction in antibiotic prescribing rate.
  - Reduced AMR infection probability over time.

## 5. Sensitivity / Scenario Analysis
- One-way: test cost, baseline antibiotic overuse rate, adherence to test results, AMR prevalence.
- Scenario: CRP-only vs multiplex POCT, urban vs rural clinics, public vs private.

## 6. Budget Impact
- Inputs: annual PHC outpatient load, suspected infections, test coverage, cost/test, antibiotic cost savings.
- Outputs: incremental program cost, antibiotics saved, net system cost change.
