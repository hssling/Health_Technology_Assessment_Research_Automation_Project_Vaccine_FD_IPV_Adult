41176393,"Innovations in the biomedical prevention, diagnosis, and service delivery of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.","The interconnectedness of the global HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemics necessitates integrated strategies to address both. This Series paper highlights the biological link between HIV and STIs, and describes the successful progress in HIV response versus STI response over the past decades. The concept of undetectable=untransmissible (U=U) in HIV treatment has revolutionised HIV prevention by reducing stigma and promoting early treatment. In line with this approach, we discuss the role of chronic suppressive therapy for herpes simplex virus type 2 and the importance of the accurate diagnosis and treatment of curable STIs to prevent transmission between sexual partners. This Series paper explores the potential of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV in different forms (eg, daily oral PrEP, event-driven PrEP, and long-acting injectable PrEP), and highlights the challenges of adherence to daily regimens and the promise of longer-acting agents, such as cabotegravir and lenacapavir. The potential of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial STIs is also discussed, with concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Although vaccine development for HIV and STIs is a key biomedical advance, we discuss the challenges and possibilities of developing effective vaccines, including lessons learnt from previous HIV vaccine trials, the potential of mRNA-based vaccines for herpes simplex virus, ongoing trials for gonorrhoea and chlamydia vaccines, and the impact of existing human papillomavirus and mpox vaccines. Diagnostic innovations emphasise the importance of point-of-care tests for HIV and STIs. This Series paper discusses the benefits, landscape, and pipeline of rapid diagnostic tests (eg, lateral flow tests and molecular assays) and the challenges of implementing these tests in low-resource settings, particularly the need for rapid results to inform clinical decisions, promote convenience, and reduce cost. This Series paper also addresses innovations in service delivery and advocates for integrated and person-centred approaches (eg, differentiated services) that combine HIV and STI services, and highlights the potential of community-based and home-based models to improve access and reduce stigma.",2025,"Lancet (London, England)",10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00983-3,Remco P H Peters; Beatriz Grinsztejn; Connie Celum; Kenneth H Mayer; Jean-Michel Molina; Sinead Delany-Moretlwe; Kenneth Ngure; Sergio Torres-Rueda; Rebecca J Guy; Peter Reiss; Rashida A Ferrand; Rossaphorn Kittiyaowamarn; Linda-Gail Bekker
41176291,Target product profile and discovery and development path for novel cryptococcal disease treatments.,"Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are World Health Organization critical and medium priority pathogens, respectively. These mainly impact people with human immunodeficiency virus residing in low- and middle-income countries, but other patient groups and settings are also affected. The high global morbidity and mortality and the limitations of current treatments provided an impetus for the development of a target product profile (TPP) for new anti-cryptococcal agents. Key attributes of the TPP include improved safety, superior (or at least comparable) activity to current treatments against all syndromes across the full disease spectrum (cryptococcal meningitis, cryptococcal pneumonia, etc.), relevance for C. neoformans and C. gattii, suitability for all age groups, oral and intravenous formulations, an acceptable treatment regimen, minimal/manageable drug-drug interactions, thermostability, and a barrier to resistance at least as high as current options. The aim of this TPP, along with the suggested discovery and development paths, is to assist all stakeholders in the development of novel cryptococcal disease treatments.",2025,The Journal of infection,10.1016/j.jinf.2025.106643,David B Meya; Manu De Rycker; Ian H Gilbert; William Hope; Justine Jelagat Odionyi; Michael Keegan; Angela Loyse; Pablo Moral-Lopez; Peter R Williamson; Lionel K Tan; Sabela Ribeiro; Timothy J Miles
41176288,Development of a bi-epitope peptide as fail-safe internal control for a modified proximity extension assay and implementation in the detection of procalcitonin in human plasma.,"Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) is a simple, minimally invasive assay developed for proteomic applications and biomarker detection in biological samples. The method is the combination of a homogeneous-phase immunoassay with quantitative PCR-based detection. With the aim of providing a fail-safe check for the successive steps of a new PEA-derived protocol, from sample addition to quantitative PCR, an internal control (IC) was designed. The IC consisted of a synthetic peptide made of the concatenation of three Amino Dioxa-octanoic Acid spacers inserted between two epitope-tags. The efficiency of the peptide design was checked in plasma spiked with the IC. It has been shown that the IC can be co-detected with at least one biomarker of diagnostic interest in human plasma specimens (here procalcitonin or PCT), without PCR cross-interference, and with no evidence of major interference with plasma proteins. The dynamic range of the IC peptide detection encompasses 3 orders of magnitude in concentration. At a given concentration, when tested in parallel with PCT on several human samples, Ct values for the IC remained stable while the Ct values for PCT decreased with increasing PCT concentrations. The work shown here represents a preliminary study aimed at establishing proof-of-concept for the use of a peptide containing two epitope tags as a suitable internal control in proximity assays.",2025,Journal of microbiological methods,10.1016/j.mimet.2025.107319,Frederic Bedin; Vincent Benoit; Agnes Rubens; Xavier Lacoux; Frederic Foucault; Pierre Imbaud
41175874,Genomic copy-number variants drive apoptotic evasion underlying acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.,"Patients who initially respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) often relapse. Here, we studied how disease-progressive (DP) clinical melanomas evolve genomically to acquire ICI resistance. Compared to patient-matched pretreatment tumors, DP tumors recurrently amplified and/or deleted anti-apoptotic and/or pro-apoptotic genes, respectively. By chronic exposure to killer T cells or ICI therapy, we derived acquired-resistant (AR) human melanoma cell lines and murine melanoma tumors that recapitulate co-occurrent copy-number variants (CNVs) of apoptotic genes observed in DP melanomas. AR and DP subclones expanded shared, private, and, in some subclones, preexistent driver CNVs. Compared to isogenic parental cells, AR melanoma cells attenuated apoptotic priming but, with overexpression of deleted pro-apoptotic genes, recovered mitochondrial priming and sensitivity to killer T cells or ICIs. In mice, pharmacologically reducing the apoptotic threshold of ICI persisters prevented relapses. Thus, CNVs can drive the evolution of resistance to ICIs in melanoma, with tumor cell-intrinsic apoptotic threshold representing a target to curtail persister evolution.",2025,Immunity,10.1016/j.immuni.2025.10.001,Mingming Wu; Shiyue Yang; Zhentao Yang; Jian Fan; Shirley H Lomeli; Prashanthi Dharanipragada; Gatien Moriceau; Robert Damoiseaux; Mark C Kelley; Carlos N Prieto-Granada; Alessio Giubellino; Mehdi Nosrati; Mohammed Kashani-Sabet; Kevin B Kim; Douglas B Johnson; Sixue Liu; Roger S Lo

41175373,AAVs targeting human carbonic anhydrase IV enhance gene delivery to the brain.,"Gene therapies using natural adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes have restricted applications, particularly in the brain, due to their poor targeting and resulting safety concerns. Directed evolution has identified brain-enhanced engineered AAV capsids for various model organisms, but inter-species differences challenge their translation. Here, we engineer AAVs to target human carbonic anhydrase IV (CA-IV), a recently identified blood-brain barrier transcytosis receptor with several favorable properties. We perform in vitro on-column selection of an AAV library to exclude capsids that do not target human CA-IV. We subsequently screen the top 0.01% of variants in vivo in mice expressing human CA-IV in brain endothelial cells. Notably, two top-performing capsids in ""humanized"" mice are relatively lower ranked in vitro and outperform several top-ranked in vitro candidates. One of these, AAV-hCA4-IV77, achieves 100-fold-greater brain transduction than AAV9, with robust neuronal and astrocytic coverage across brain regions. These results advance our understanding of receptor-targeted capsid design and support the therapeutic potential of human CA-IV-engaging AAVs.",2025,Cell reports,10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116419,Changfan Lin; Xinhong Chen; Jonathan D Hoang; Fiona Ristic; Yujie Fan; Seongmin Jang; Jin Hyung Alex Chung; Erin E Sullivan; Tomasz Gawda; Bill Kavvathas; Irene Tran; Yitong Li; Andrew D Steele; Timothy F Shay; Viviana Gradinaru

41175228,MOF-818 nanozyme-based biosensor for specific point-of-care testing of Bacillus subtilis in complex agricultural soil.,"Bacillus subtilis (BS) effectively suppresses soilborne pathogens and enhances crop resistance through various mechanisms. However, its efficacy is significantly influenced by effective inter-root colonization rates, among other factors, necessitating precise quantitative monitoring for optimal application. Conventional detection methods are often time-consuming and technically demanding, limiting their application in the field. To address this challenge, we developed a dual-recognition biosensing platform. Specifically, tridentate-functionalized aptamer was utilized for rapid BS enrichment and secondary recognition achieved using fragment crystallizable mannose-binding lectin (FcMBL)-modified nanozyme (MOF-818). The rigid scaffold of MOF-818 ensured superior catechol oxidase activity and environmental stability, facilitating sensitive and robust online quantification of BS in complex soil matrices.

41175191,The beneficial effects of empagliflozin-metformin combination on cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial disease closely associated with increased cardiovascular risk, involving insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has shown cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Empagliflozin-Metformin combination on cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM patients. In this cross-sectional study, 124 participants were divided into three groups: healthy control group (n = 50), T2DM patients treated with metformin alone (Met group, n = 37), and T2DM patients treated with Empagliflozin-Metformin combination (Empa-Met group, n = 37). Serum levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, hs-CRP, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and free thiol groups (-SH) were measured. IR was assessed using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), and cardiovascular risk was estimated using the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and lipid ratios. The Empa-Met group exhibited significantly higher FBG levels and lower levels of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), insulin, LDL/HDL, TC/HDL ratios, and HOMA-IR compared to the Met group. The Empa-Met group also showed significantly higher -SH levels and lower MDA levels compared to the Met group. Correlation analyses revealed significant correlations between oxidative stress markers, IR, and atherogenic indices. Empagliflozin-Metformin combination therapy may offer additional benefits over metformin monotherapy in improving lipid parameters, IR, and oxidative stress in T2DM patients. These findings support the potential cardioprotective role of empagliflozin and highlight the need for long-term interventional studies to confirm our results.",2025,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,10.1007/s00210-025-04719-2,Maryam Aghajani Bac; Zahra Nasehi; Fouzieh Zadhoush

41174235,Click-code-seq reveals strand biases of DNA oxidation and depurination in human genome.,"DNA modifications drive aging, neurodegeneration, carcinogenesis and chemotherapy drug action. Accurate mapping of diverse DNA modifications with single-nucleotide precision in complex genomes remains challenging. We upgraded click-code-seq, a click-chemistry-aided DNA-modification mapping strategy, to enable its first application for sequencing oxidation and depurination in the human genome. We developed a companion fluorescence assay, click-fluoro-quant, to rapidly quantify common DNA modifications and novel adaptors to minimize false positives and assess modification frequency. We uncovered that endogenous DNA oxidation in a human cell line mirrors cancer mutational signatures linked to oxidative stress. The chemotherapy drug irofulven preferentially induces depurination in ApA dimers and promoters. Notably, oxidized guanines and apurinic sites, both irofulven induced and endogenous, are depleted in gene transcribed strands, with the strand bias increasing with gene expression. This work substantially advances click-code-seq for deciphering the impacts of key modifications in human DNA on cellular physiology and toxicological responses.",2025,Nature chemical biology,10.1038/s41589-025-02052-6,Vakil Takhaveev; Nikolai J L Püllen; Navnit K Singh; Lucie Lefevre; Emilie A Aghajani; Sabrina M Huber; Stefan Schauer; Hailey L Gahlon; Anna R Poetsch; Shana J Sturla

41174009,Steric stabilization-independent stealth cloak enables nanoreactors-mediated starvation therapy against refractory cancer.,"The high interfacial energy of nanomaterials limits their certain biomedical applications that require stealthiness to minimize non-specific interaction with biological components. While steric repulsion-based entropic stabilization-such as PEGylation-has long been the dominant strategy for designing stealth nanomaterials, its inherent softness and susceptibility to dynamic deformation and external forces often result in only moderate stealth performance. Here we report a distinct approach to achieving stealthiness by harnessing an ion-pair network, rather than maximizing steric repulsion. Using model polyion complex nanoparticles composed of equimolar charge ratios of polycations and polyanions, we demonstrate that increasing crosslinks between the constituent polyions beyond a critical threshold effectively reduces protein adsorption and macrophage uptake, enabling prolonged circulation with a half-life exceeding 100 hours. Building on this, we develop an asparaginase-loaded vesicular nanoreactor enveloped by a semi-permeable ion-pair network sheath for asparagine starvation therapy. The extended circulation of these nanoreactors enables sustained depletion of asparagine, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes for metastatic breast and pancreatic cancers. Our findings open an avenue for improving the pharmacokinetics of nanomaterials for therapeutic delivery through delicately engineering stable intermolecular structures with holistic cooperativity.",2025,Nature biomedical engineering,10.1038/s41551-025-01534-1,Junjie Li; Kazuko Toh; Panyue Wen; Xueying Liu; Anjaneyulu Dirisala; Haochen Guo; Joachim F R Van Guyse; Saed Abbasi; Yasutaka Anraku; Yuki Mochida; Hiroaki Kinoh; Horacio Cabral; Masaru Tanaka; Kazunori Kataoka

41172793,Plasma fatty acids levels and risk of schizophrenia in the UK Biobank: a prospective cohort study.,"Fatty acid (FA) metabolism is essential in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, yet prospective evidence linking plasma FAs to schizophrenia risk remains limited. This study aims to investigate the association between plasma FAs and the risk of schizophrenia, and to identify key potential mediators involved in this relationship. This study used plasma FAs data, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), from 273,458 schizophrenia-free participants in the UK Biobank. Cox regression models assessed schizophrenia risk based on FA quartiles or 1-SD increments. Mediation analyses were conducted to identify potential intermediate factors underlying these associations. Our results showed that SFAs [HR per 1-SD: 1.11 (95 % CI: 1.05-1.16)] were positively associated with schizophrenia risk, while PUFAs [HR per 1-SD: 0.94 (95 % CI: 0.92-0.97)], particularly n-6 PUFAs [HR per 1-SD: 0.94 (95 % CI: 0.92-0.97)] and linoleic acid (LA) [HR per 1-SD: 0.94 (95 % CI: 0.91-0.97)], exhibited a protective association. Furthermore, C-reactive protein (CRP) was identified as a mediator in the effects of these associations. In conclusion, plasma SFAs may be involved in increasing the risk of schizophrenia, whereas PUFAs, particularly n-6 PUFAs and LA, may have protective effects. Moreover, the observed mediating role of CRP suggests that inflammation could potentially link FAs to schizophrenia.",2025,Psychiatry research,10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116805,Xinru Guo; Songyu Wu; Tingyi Jia; Zhouyang Sun; Ge Yu; Changgui Kou; Wei Bai

It plays a vital role in the diagnosis of bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular risk assessment. However, conventional detection techniques often struggle to balance high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range. Here, we developed and validated a novel fluorescence-based aptasensor named AuCA (AuNP-enhanced CRISPR Aptasensor), which integrates nucleic acid aptamers, magnetic beads (MBs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and the CRISPR/Cas12a system for robust CRP quantification. In this system, MBs functionalized with aptamer 1 selectively captured the target protein, while AuNPs co-modified with aptamer 2 and a Cas12a activation sequence (Trigger) enabled efficient signal transduction. Upon target binding, the Trigger activated the Cas12a/crRNA complex, initiating trans-cleavage of fluorescent reporters and producing a markedly amplified signal. The optimized AuCA platform achieved a low detection limit of 60 ng mL",2025,Journal of materials chemistry. B,10.1039/d5tb01727k,Siyue Wang; Xiaotian Guan; Shuqing Sun
41170570,Preoperative predictors of mortality in intestinal perforation.,"Bowel perforation represents a prevalent and life-threatening emergency within general surgical pathology. This study aims to evaluate clinical and biochemical parameters that predict mortality in cases of bowel perforation. A retrospective analysis was performed on 144 patients who underwent surgical intervention for bowel perforation between 2019 and 2024. Key variables assessed included the albumin/creatinine ratio, age, serum albumin levels, CRP, and history of COVID-19. Mortality-associated variables were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, as well as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean age of the patients was 60 years, with 84 patients (58.3%) being male. The overall mortality rate was 25%. Independent predictors of mortality identified in the study included an albumin/creatinine ratio <3.38 (odds ratio [OR]: 12.666, p<0.001), age >66 years (OR: 3.273, p=0.036), and serum albumin levels <3 g/dL (OR: 5.653, p=0.002). ROC analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) for the albumin/creatinine ratio was 0.879, establishing it as the parameter with the highest predictive accuracy for mortality. Among patients with a history of COVID-19, ischemia was the predominant cause of perforation (87.5%), while malignancy was the leading cause (41.4%) in those without a COVID-19 history. This difference in etiology was statistically significant (p<0.001). In conclusion, the albumin/creatinine ratio, age, and serum albumin levels are robust parameters for predicting mortality in bowel perforation cases. Furthermore, a history of COVID-19 significantly increases the risk of bowel perforation due to ischemia.",2025,Biomolecules & biomedicine,10.17305/bb.2025.13309,Fırat Canlıkarakaya; Serhat Ocaklı; İbrahim Doğan; Nurhak Cihangir Çınkıl; Hüseyin Turap; Cengiz Ceylan

41170250,Predictive Value of C-Reactive Protein/Albumin Ratio in Acute Pancreatitis.,"Background Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and potentially life-threatening condition with a wide spectrum of severity. While most cases are mild, a subset progresses to severe disease with high mortality. This study evaluates the predictive value of the C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio (CAR), an inflammation-based biomarker, in determining AP severity. Methods A prospective, observational study was conducted among adult patients diagnosed with AP. CRP and albumin levels were measured at presentation, and CAR was calculated and categorized into three quantiles (≤6.7, 6.7-30.5, ≥30.5). Associations between CAR quantiles and disease severity were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Pearson correlation assessed the relationship between CAR and hospital stay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate diagnostic performance, with optimal cutoffs determined by Youden's index. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated at both the Youden cutoff and a lower pragmatic threshold. Results Among the 80 participants (55% male; median age 44.5 years), the median CAR was 12.7. No patients in the lowest CAR quantile developed severe AP. CAR demonstrated good discriminatory ability for severe AP (AUC 0.862). The optimal Youden cutoff of 18.39 yielded 100% sensitivity and 69.4% specificity. At a lower cutoff of 10.28, sensitivity remained 100%, while specificity decreased to 40.3%. CAR values were positively correlated with hospital stay duration (r = 0.568, p < 0.001). Conclusion CAR is a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive marker that predicts AP severity. Low CAR values are associated with a reduced risk of severe AP. Using CAR, particularly at a lower threshold, may help identify high-risk patients early and guide management decisions in resource-limited settings.",2025,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.93436,Nischal Khanal; Amrit Baral; Shristi Shrestha; Paleswan Joshi Lakhey; Ramesh Singh Bhandari

41169506,Human indels as predictors of antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines.,"Vaccine efficacy varies significantly among adults. This variability underlies the limitation of a one-size-fits-all vaccination strategy and the need for more personalized approaches. We investigated factors influencing inter-individual variability in antibody responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine among adults. Neutralizing antibody (nAb) levels after the first vaccine dose were associated with infection outcomes within 1 year after vaccination, suggesting their potential as a correlate of protection. Age, sex, and Chinese ethnicity were associated with nAb and anti-spike protein antibody levels. Two indels located at chr1:31433042 and chr15:76311269 showed significant association with antibody responses. Leveraging these host factors, we developed a Random Forest model that predicted vaccine-induced antibody responses with 72.7% accuracy for mRNA vaccine and 76.9% for the Sinopharm COVID-19 inactivated virus vaccine. These findings support predictive modeling as a tool to identify individuals at risk of low vaccine responses, enabling more targeted and effective vaccination strategies.",2025,iScience,10.1016/j.isci.2025.113475,Hsiuyi V Chen; Siew-Wai Fong; Yun Shan Goh; Matthew Zirui Tay; Angeline Rouers; Zi Wei Chang; Andrea Wei Ming Chua; Liang Hui Loo; Jean-Marc Chavatte; Raymond Tzer Pin Lin; Yee-Sin Leo; Chiea Chuen Khor; David C Lye; Laurent Renia; Barnaby Edward Young; Lisa F P Ng
